# DABC-Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of the repository is to retrieve various types of GeoJSON data, and to create different types of maps using Javascript, HTML, and Leaflet to visualize the data in a user-friendly manner. The Earthquake challenge retrieves earthquake data of the past 7 days and creates 3 layers (All earthquakes, major earthquakes, and also the tectonic plates) with 3 different types of maps (Streets, Satellite Streets, and Dark) available for the user to pick and choose how many layers of data to be presented on which type of map. Each earthquake is presented as a Circle Marker with varying sizes depending on the magnitude of the earthquake; a legend is presented on the bottom right of the map to indicate the magnitude associated with each color.
